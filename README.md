#ET FE Test

To do this project I used [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15 in order to accelerate the development time.

## Install the project

- To install the project first you need to `npm i -g angular-cli@latest` to have angular-cli installed globally
- After that you can clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/juliettemaxwell/fe-challenge.git` and run `npm install`

## Run the project on development

Use `ng serve` to start a dev server for the project. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`

## Location of exercises

The first exercise can be found at `http://localhost:4200/`

The second exercise can be found at `http://localhost:4200/form`

## Run unit tests

Use `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Run end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). 
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
